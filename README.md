**SAS Proc Append Macro**
This repository contains SAS logic to append data over a user-inputted number of iterations. 

# Purpose
Append data over a user-inputted number of iterations. 

# Example
If the user would like to visualise monthly metrics over the period of 1 year, this macro can be applied. This approach overcomes the requirement to write repeated code 12 times, to extract the relevant data from each month of the year.

# Further Details
For a tutorial on how this macro can be applied, refer to my Udemy course on SAS macros:
